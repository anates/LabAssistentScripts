## About The Project

The scripts in this project are intended to be used for simplified data analysis and figure generation of 
* Data generated by different optical spectrum analyzers
* Data generated by different methods of autocorrelation for measuring the pulse duration of ultra-short laser pulses

The scripts can
* Plot data
* Estimate energy of the entire spectrum/part of the spectrum
* Fit gaussian/sech-functions to estimate the FWHM of the autocorrelation/spectrum
* Save the resulting figures as tikz/png
* other things currently not documented

## Comments

This project is still a WiP, and therefore contains stubs for documentation, and undocumented features. Moreover, several functions might be broken/not available. Due to lack of testing material those functions currently can not be tested.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/anates/LabAssistentScripts/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
